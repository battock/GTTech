        I just wanted to write a second screen to show navigation and in place of a Read.me file.
        There are a few things I didt implement in this app due to time constraints that I would have in a full production app.
        Here are the improvements I would make if i had more timeâ€¦
        \n\n\n
        *  I would have had drop downs for each make and model box on the search screen to show possible makes and also associated models.
        \n\n
        *  Drop down in the year box to show all available years. I would thnk in a proper app this information would be provided through an api on start up of the search screen to show all available options.
        \n\n
        *  I have not added any filters etc as it was not specified in the test criteria.
        \n\n
        *  I added a sealed class to track the network response. I havent added a loading enum or a progress spinner for this MVP but the sealed class allows for that sort of thing to be added quite easily. I only added error and success scenarios to show how it would be handled.
        \n\n\n\n
